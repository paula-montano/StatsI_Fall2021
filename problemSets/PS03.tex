	\maketitle
	\section*{Instructions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Please show your work! You may lose points by simply writing in the answer. If the problem requires you to execute commands in \texttt{R}, please include the code you used to get your answers. Please also include the \texttt{.R} file that contains your code. If you are not sure if work needs to be shown for a particular problem, please ask.
		\item Your homework should be submitted electronically on GitHub in \texttt{.pdf} form.
		\item This problem set is due before class on Friday November 12, 2021. No late assignments will be accepted.
		\item Total available points for this homework is 80.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	\vspace{.25cm}
	
	\noindent In this problem set, you will run several regressions and create an add variable plot (see the lecture slides) in \texttt{R} using the \texttt{incumbents\_subset.csv} dataset. Include all of your code.
	
	\vspace{.5cm}
	\section*{Question 1} %(20 points)}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.	\vspace{5cm}

			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=56, lastline=57]{PS03.R}  
	
	\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 	\vspace{7cm}

\section*{Question 2}% (20 points)}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference between incumbent and challenger's spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party are related.	\vspace{.25cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{presvote} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.	\vspace{5cm}

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=85, lastline=86]{PS03.R} 
		
\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 	\vspace{5cm}

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=94, lastline=99]{PS03.R}

\item Write the prediction equation.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage	
\section*{Question 3}% (20 points)}

\noindent We are interested in knowing how the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party is associated with the incumbent's electoral success.
\vspace{.25cm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{presvote}.

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=114, lastline=115]{PS03.R} 
		
\vspace{5cm}
\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=118, lastline=120]{PS03.R} 
		
									\includegraphics{Rplot5.png}
									
\vspace{5cm}
\item Write the prediction equation.

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=122, lastline=127]{PS03.R} 
		
\end{enumerate}

\newpage	
\section*{Question 4}% (20 points)}
\noindent The residuals from part (a) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{voteshare} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger. The residuals in part (b) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{presvote} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger in the district.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the residuals from Question 1 and the explanatory variable is the residuals from Question 2.	\vspace{6cm}

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=136, lastline=137]{PS03.R} 

\item Make a scatterplot of the two residuals and add the regression line. 	\vspace{6cm}

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=140, lastline=142]{PS03.R} 
		
										\includegraphics{Rplot6.png}
											
\item Write the prediction equation.

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=144, lastline=148]{PS03.R} 
		
\end{enumerate}

\newpage	

\section*{Question 5}% (20 points)}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the incumbent's \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variables are \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}.

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=157, lastline=158]{PS03.R} 
		
	\vspace{5cm}
\item Write the prediction equation.	\vspace{5cm}

		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=160, lastline=164]{PS03.R} 
		
\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?%	\vspace{5cm}
%	\item Reflect on your finding. Don't write anything. Just think about it.

	\texttt The output that is identical in  question 4 is the residual standard error coefficient (0.07339 ).  In question 4 the variation in voteshare is not explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger, while in question 5 the voteshare variation is explained by the difference between the incumbent and challenger.  \\
